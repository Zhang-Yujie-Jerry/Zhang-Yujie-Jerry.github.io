I am currently an Assistant Professor at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2017, and my Ph.D. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Ross Murch](https://eermurch.home.ece.ust.hk/) (IEEE Fellow). I worked as a Post-Doctoral Fellow at HKUST from 2021-2023, and a Research Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS), supervised by [Prof. Xudong Chen](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/elechenx/) (IEEE Fellow).

Research Interests

My research lies in antennas and applied electromagnetics, with a focus on creating novel electromagnetic technologies for a better world! My group’s research will explore innovative areas such as:
▪ Reconfigurable Intelligent Antennas and Surfaces 
▪ Multiple Input Multiple output (MIMO) wireless systems
▪ MIMO Antenna Design
▪ Pixel Antenna Design and Optimization
▪ RF and Microwave Circuit Design
▪ Electromagnetic Inverse Design Problem
▪ Inverse Scattering and RF Imaging
▪ RF Energy Harvesting and Wireless Power Transfer
▪ Physics-Assisted Artificial Intelligence
▪ 6G wireless communications and Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems

Openings
======
We have multiple PhD, Postdoc and visiting student and scholar positions! We look forward for self-motivated researchers to join our group!

Updates
======
